# Messaging System Fixes

## Issues Identified:
1. Messages created but blank/empty
2. Sender can't send messages to thread
3. Receiver doesn't see conversation in their list
4. Receiver gets no notification about new messages

## Root Causes:
1. Missing notification creation when messages are sent
2. Conversation creation doesn't properly notify receiver
3. Real-time updates not working for conversation lists
4. Message sending may have validation issues

## Solutions Applied:
1. ✅ Enhanced message sending to create notifications for receivers
2. ✅ Fixed conversation creation to ensure both participants are properly added
3. ✅ Added real-time subscriptions for conversation updates (both participants and conversations tables)
4. ✅ Improved error handling and validation for message input
5. ✅ Added notification creation when new conversations are started
6. ✅ Enhanced UI feedback with loading states and better validation

## Technical Implementation:
- Modified sendMessage() to create notifications with message preview
- Enhanced getOrCreateDirectConversation() to notify friend about new conversation
- Added real-time subscriptions in useConversations hook
- Improved message validation and UI feedback in ConversationPage
- Added proper error handling throughout the message flow

## Expected Results:
- Messages will no longer be blank
- Receivers will see new conversations in their list immediately
- Receivers will get notifications about new messages and conversations
- Better user experience with loading states and validation

## Additional Fix - Multiple Subscription Issue:
- ✅ Created separate useConversationsRealtime hook with singleton pattern
- ✅ Moved real-time subscription to app level (SupabaseIndex.tsx)
- ✅ Prevents "tried to subscribe multiple times" error
- ✅ Ensures only one subscription per user across all components

## Files Added:
- useConversationsRealtime.ts - Singleton real-time subscription management
